Emby "LiveTV" plugin for MythTV with changes for Emby 4.0+. 

2019-01-24: So far I haven't confirmed it works for viewing recordings, just that it can load and get recording groups.
2019-01-25: Seems OK for viewing recordings, LiveTV seems not to work though, will look at that when I get chance.

To install, build and place in the Emby server plugins folder.

Binary and source for older Emby versions (pre 4.0) may be downloaded from https://github.com/ta264/Emby.MythTv
