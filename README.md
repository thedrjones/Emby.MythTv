Emby "LiveTV" plugin for MythTV with changes for Emby 4.0+. 

2019-01-24: So far I haven't confirmed it works for viewing recordings, just that it can load and get recording groups.

To install, build and place in the Emby server plugins folder.

Binary and source for older Emby versions (pre 4.0) may be downloaded from https://github.com/ta264/Emby.MythTv
